# Portfolio Website To-do

## Tasks to complete for first deployment

- [x] Begin lazy loading images: <https://web.dev/browser-level-image-lazy-loading/>
- [x] Optimize images (convert to webp? did it!)
- [x] Move image preview in ProjectCard component to img element instead of background of div
- [x] Fix breadcrumbs now that we have a page title resolver\n\nIntroduce markdown support
- [x] Implement hyphens on ProjectCard components: <https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hyphens>
- [x] Add 'back' button to Projects page for mobile users, or make it clearer that clicking the url at the top will bring you home (I think it's clear enough)
- [x] Double-check auto page name implementation (ended up removing it entirely)

## Tasks to experiment with later

- [ ] Add sorting or filtering to projects
- [ ] Make an animation happen on homepage on page load: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6805482/css3-transition-animation-on-load>
- [ ] Figure out Vercel deployment
- [ ] Add markdown support for projects
- [ ] Add markdown editor for projects
- [ ] Add experience / resume section
- [x] Figure out why elements shift so much on first page load
