## The Problem

Before beginning this project, I realized I had several *wants* that could all be taken care of by making a site like this:

- A reason to organize and polish my portfolio in the first place
- An internet presence, a place where I can point people towards my experience
- To learn how to use SvelteKit
- Most importantly, more motivation to start and complete projects, as now there's a place to publish them

Along the journey, I solidified my idea and laid out the following guidelines:

- Has to look nice (I need to put effort into making it look polished and refined)
- Has to be easy to modify and maintain
- Has to be easy and intiutive to navigate (should be easy, it's a very basic site)

## The Solution

Once I had laid out my wants and guidelines, completed the [Svelte and SvelteKit tutorials](https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/welcome-to-svelte), and binged some educational YouTube tutorials (big thank you to [Joy of Code](https://www.youtube.com/@JoyofCodeDev) and [Huntabyte](https://www.youtube.com/@Huntabyte)), I felt I was ready to start creating my own site.

When I had attempted this project previously, the best I had ended up with was a plain-colored background behind my name and some links to my social media. This time, however, with newfound motivation and [Skeleton](https://www.skeleton.dev/) under my belt, I was able to iterate quickly with some great UI elements pre-made for me.

With the right tooling, the site quickly took form. After some googling, I ended up using [MDsveX](https://mdsvex.com/) for Markdown parsing in order to easily write and quickly edit these project "write-ups". Some other libaries and tools used include [floating-ui](https://floating-ui.com/) and [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Goals

There's more that I'd like to add to this site, namely...

- ~~Markdown support for project pages~~ (done)
- Full project pages
- An integrated project editor
- A way to add comments to these project pages
- An "experience" section
- More animations and effects
- Improved header and footer
- Filtering by project tags
- Searching by project name

If you have any suggestions, please reach out.
