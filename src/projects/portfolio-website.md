## The Problem

There are a couple desires I had that drove me to create this website:

1. To have a reason to organize and polish my portfolio in the first place

1. To learn how to use SvelteKit

```js
let test = "test"
```

test text

```python
var = 1
for i in range(var):
    print("doodoo")
```

## The Solution

This website uses SvelteKit as a framework, Skeleton for UI elements, and TailwindCSS to ease styling and speed up the design process. I use Vercel for hosting and deployment. This project has been my first experience using these tools.
