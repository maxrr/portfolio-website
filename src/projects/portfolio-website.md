## Portfolio Website

This website uses SvelteKit as a framework, Skeleton for UI elements, and TailwindCSS to ease styling and speed up the design process. I use Vercel for hosting and deployment. This project has been my first experience using these tools.

While I've had a presence on the internet since 2014, when I first started hosting a game server for myself and some friends, every website I've made has been entirely or partially made using a creator tool like Weebly or Mobirise. This development experience has given me a much better perspective on the web design process and how frameworks ease it - I've much preferred my experience with SvelteKit than with React - and has re-familiarized me with HTML and CSS.

There is lots more that I plan to add to this site.
