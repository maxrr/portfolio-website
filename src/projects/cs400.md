teaser: An introductory programming course that covered intermediate-level data structures and algorithms. Projects were completed in groups of four.

CS 400 covered more data structures like hash tables, red-black and self-balancing trees, and Dijkstra's algorithm. Nothing super complex, but we were given more time consuming assignments and projects than in CS300.

For each of these topics, we were assigned a group project. Our groups were of eight people with two teams of four - a red and a blue team - with each team member assigned a unique role: data wrangler, algorithm engineer, frontend, or backend.

The three large projects in this class required Git to collaborate with teammates. While I had used git previously, being required to use it for these projects reinforced my skills and showed me new things when using it in a group setting.

I've outlined my personal contributions to the projects in the linked repository. Unfortunately, I'm unable to upload the full, group versions due to plagiarism concerns.
