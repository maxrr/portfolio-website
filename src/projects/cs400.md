teaser: An introductory programming course that covered intermediate-level data structures and algorithms. Projects were completed in groups of four.

CS 400 was a decent step up from 300. In this course, we covered more intermediate data structures like hash tables, red-black and self-balancing trees, and Dijkstra's algorithm. Still nothing super complex, but we were given more time consuming assignments and projects than in 300.

For each of these big topics (there were more, but these three were the main course focus), we were assigned a group project. Our groups were of 8 people with two teams of four - a red and a blue team - with each person in each team having a unique role: data wrangler, algorithm engineer, frontend, or backend.

The three large projects in this class "required" Git to collaboate with teammates. While I had used git previously, being "required" to use it for these projects reinforced my skills and showed me new things when using it in a non-solo setting.

I've outlined my personal contributions to the projects in the linked repository, I still haven't gotten around to pushing the full projects.
