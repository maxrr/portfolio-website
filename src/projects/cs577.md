teaser: One of the most challenging Computer Science courses I've been required to take, Algorithms required me to think analytically and deeply about the problems we were given.

Algorithms has a reputation for being one of the hardest mandatory CS courses at my school, and that was my experience. It was a class whose core content wasn't overwhelmingly challenging, but the quantity of material and the speed at which the class went really upped the difficulty.

The course instructional staff let us pick from many languages when implementing algorithms as weekly assignments. I ended up choosing Python for its comparatively small amount of boilerplate, its high-level implementations of many basic data structures, and because I wasn't particularly worried about getting the best possible performance.

I've outlined the prompts and given my solutions in the linked repository.
