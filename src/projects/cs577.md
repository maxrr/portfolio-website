teaser: One of the most challenging Computer Science courses I've been required to take, Algorithms required me to think analytically and deeply about the problems we were given.

This algorithms course had a reputation as one of/the most difficult, mandatory CS courses at my school. That was my experience. The course's core content wasn't overwhelmingly challenging, but the quantity of material and the speed at which we moved to new topics made staying afloat very difficult.

The course instructional staff let us pick from several languages when completing our weekly assignments, which would usually be implementing an algorithm that we discussed in lecture. I chose Python for its little boilerplate and its high-level implementations of many basic data structures.

I've outlined the prompts and given my solutions in the linked repository.
