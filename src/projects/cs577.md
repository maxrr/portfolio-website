teaser: One of the most challenging Computer Science courses I've been required to take, Algorithms required me to think analytically and deeply about the problems we were given.

Algorithms has a reputation for being one of the hardest mandatory CS courses at my school, and that was my experience. The course instructional staff let us pick from many languages when implementing algorithms as weekly assignments.

I chose Python for its comparatively small amount of boilerplate, and because I wasn't particularly worried about getting the best possible performance.

The algorithms given to us to implement weren't incredibly complex (the difficulty of the course lied mostly in the exam prep and lengthy homeworks), so what you'll see in the linked repository isn't anything that'll blow your socks off.
