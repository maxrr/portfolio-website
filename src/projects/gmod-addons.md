teaser: I ran a game server for myself and some friends for roughly eight years. In my time, I used YouTube tutorials to learn Lua and build what I wanted to see.

Over many years I worked to create and maintain custom addons for a [server](https://hgaming.net/) I ran on a game called Garry's Mod. This server began in 2014 and was shut down in 2022. I worked on these addons both solo and with a fellow developer and friend, and spent many late nights debugging really horrible spaghetti code.

Before starting with these addons, the most advanced programming I had done were some JavaScript tutorials on Codecademy and watching (not trying!) beginner YouTube tutorials. Whenever I look back at what was written for these addons, I'm sure that if I were to do this whole thing again, you can bet I'd do it a lot differently.
