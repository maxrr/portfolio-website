teaser: I ran a game server for myself and some friends for roughly eight years. In my time, I used YouTube tutorials to learn Lua and build what I wanted to see.

Over several years, I worked to create and maintain custom addons for a [Garry's Mod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garry%27s_Mod) [server](https://hgaming.net/). This server began in 2014 and was shut down in 2022. I worked on these addons both solo and with a fellow developer and friend, and spent many late nights debugging really horrible spaghetti code.

Before starting with these addons, the most advanced programming I had done were some JavaScript tutorials on Codecademy and watching (not trying!) beginner YouTube tutorials.

I attribute lots of my motivation to learn general programming concepts on my own to these addons - when I had an issue, I would fall down rabbit holes learning about Big O notation, runtime efficiency, high-level networking concepts, and data structures. Whenever I look back at the source code for these addons, I cringe a little bit, and know that if I were to do this whole thing again, that I'd do it very differently.
