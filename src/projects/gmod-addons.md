teaser: I ran a game server for myself and some friends for roughly eight years. In my time, I used YouTube tutorials to learn Lua and build what I wanted to see.

Over many years I worked to create and maintain custom addons for a server I ran on a game called Garry's Mod. This server began in 2014 and was shut down in 2022. I worked on these addons both solo and with a fellow developer and friend, and spent many late nights debugging really horrible spaghetti code.

I learned a whole bunch through these addons. Before this, the most advanced programming I had done were some JavaScript tutorials on Codecademy and from following beginner YouTube tutorials. I find it really fun to look back at how it all began with horribly optimized implementations. If I were to do this whole thing again, you can bet I'd do it a lot differently.

Very much looking forward to S&box's full release.
